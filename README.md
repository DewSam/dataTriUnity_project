# Vbay Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence Solution

## Project Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a robust data warehouse and business intelligence (BI) solution for a bidding platform, Vbay. The project aimed to enable data-driven decision-making by leveraging the Kimball methodology to design the data warehouse and develop comprehensive BI solutions. The core focus is on transforming raw data from a bidding database into actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Objectives

### 1. **Design a Data Warehouse**
- Apply the **Kimball methodology** to design a tailored data warehouse architecture.
- Identify key business processes and create dimensional models.
- Establish efficient **ETL processes** to ensure the data is structured for analysis.

### 2. **Implement ETL Processes**
- Develop **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** workflows to extract raw data from cloud storage, transform it, and load it into the data warehouse.
- Ensure **data quality, consistency, and integrity** throughout the transformation process.

### 3. **Develop Business Intelligence Solutions**
- Create comprehensive BI dashboards using **Power BI**.
- Provide stakeholders with **actionable insights** through interactive visualizations.

## Tools & Methodologies

### 1. **Data Warehouse Platform: Snowflake**
- A scalable, cloud-based data warehouse used to store and manage structured data.
- **S3** was used to store the raw data, which was then ingested into Snowflake for further processing.

### 2. **Data Transformation: dbt (Data Build Tool)**
- **dbt** was used to clean and transform raw data into structured datasets ready for analysis.
- Version control with **GIT** was employed to track changes and ensure reproducibility.

### 3. **Business Intelligence: Power BI**
- Power BI was used to create **user-friendly BI dashboards** to enable stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## Project Lifecycle

The following milestones outline the major stages of the project:

### 1. **Milestone 1 - Bus Matrix**
- Created the **Bus Matrix**, identifying key business processes and defining relevant fact and dimension tables.

### 2. **Milestone 2 - Dimensional Model and ETL Implementation**
- Refined the **dimensional model** based on initial feedback.
- Built **data pipelines** and implemented transformations using dbt to load and clean the data in Snowflake.

### 3. **Milestone 3 - Business Intelligence (BI)**
- Delivered a comprehensive BI demonstration by connecting the **data warehouse to Power BI** and building interactive dashboards.

## Learning Outcomes

### 1. **Data Collection, Storage, and Access**
- Utilized **Snowflake** and **dbt** for efficient data collection, storage, and access.
- Implemented an **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** process to transform raw data from an S3 bucket into analytics-ready datasets in Snowflake.

### 2. **Actionable Insights from the Full Data Science Life Cycle**
- Applied the **Kimball methodology** and created a **star schema** data model to transform raw data into structured insights.

### 3. **Visualization and Predictive Modeling**
- Created **Power BI dashboards** for visualizing Vbay's bidding behavior and customer satisfaction, delivering insights based on data modeling.

### 4. **Programming for Data Manipulation**
- Leveraged **SQL** and **dbt** for data transformations, implementing best practices for **data manipulation** and analysis.

## Final Deliverables

- **Data Warehouse**: Built using Snowflake, with data sourced from cloud storage (S3) and transformed using dbt.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Comprehensive pipeline to extract, load, and transform data into structured formats.
- **Business Intelligence Dashboards**: Two intuitive **Power BI dashboards** providing insights into Vbay's bidding behavior and customer satisfaction.
